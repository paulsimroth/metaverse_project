# metaverse_project

In this repository you can find my version of the Moraland metaverse done as part of the course "Create your Metaverse"
The following repository is the starting point from which the coding started: https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/youtube-tutorials/tree/main/Metaverse-Starter

As part of the course the communication was done with the now deprecated version of Moralis Servers V1. 
I instead chose ethersjs to handle the communication between the front end and the smart contract.
I also slightly changed the smart contract.

## Technology Stack & Tools
